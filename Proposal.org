* Overview
The purpose of this course is to allow students to build and experience an
environment that increases workflow and is tailored to the needs of the
individual. Topics and material that will be covered in this course will include
the tools computer scientists used daily and how to adapt to new,
innovative tools. These tools include the Unix command-line, Emacs and Vim
text-editors, Git version control system, LaTeX typesetting system, and Shell
scripting. Not only will the students learn how to use these tools, but practice
using them in meaningful projects and assignments that will carry with them past
the course and in their day to day lives as computer scientists.
* EATU in detail
The Primary focus of this course will to be using the GNU Emacs text editor to
complete various tasks that would normally require multiple environments and
work-spaces. Emacs is a powerful tool that goes beyond simple text editing for
various languages. In this course students will learn to use Emacs as a word
processor, interactive presentation display manager, excel-like spreadsheet
manager, organization tool, extended Git version controller, and programming
environment for all programming languages. In learning to use them students will
also learn other Unix tools such as Git and shell scripting.
